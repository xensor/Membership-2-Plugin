This add-on allows you to set up a page for banned groups and also a maintenance page based on staff levels. You can enter the id(s) in the admin panel so it's all easy to do from a page. 

== Description ==

This is still in beta, so please be patience as we make sure that this plugin works fully.

The idea was to create a plugin for Membership Pro 2 from WMPUDEV that allows admins to set up a banned page to redirect banned members to and also put the website into maintenance using their own maintenance page. I always got tired of using premade maintenance pages. 

I will also be looking into how to set up regular wp roles as a option as well for the ban option and maintenance. Right now, I am using Membership Pro.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `maintenance.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Dashboard -> Settings -> Maintenance and fill in the details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

This allows admin(s) to set up ban pages and maintenance pages and then set the `page id` into the fields to be redirected to. This isn't just a redirect on login, it actually redirects them during the whole visit. 

= What is required? =

Membership 2 from WMPUDEV. (I have not tested it with the free version.)

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
